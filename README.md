# iOS File Tweak Tool (PoC)

A simple iOS application that attempts to apply various UI and sound tweaks by zeroing out the first page of specific system files. This project is a Proof of Concept and demonstrates the use of a file-zeroing technique.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE ‚ö†Ô∏è**
This tool modifies system files. While the targeted files are generally for UI or sound resources, any modification to system files carries risk.
- **Use exclusively on a test device.**
- **Incorrect use or targeting the wrong files could lead to system instability, visual glitches, or in worst-case scenarios, require a device restore.**
- Most tweaks require a **manual respring or reboot** for changes to take effect.
- The effectiveness of these tweaks is highly dependent on the iOS version and device. They may not work as expected or at all on patched/newer iOS versions.
- Files on the Sealed System Volume (SSV) may be restored by the OS upon reboot.

## Features

-   Apply various UI tweaks (e.g., hide dock, transparent UI elements).
-   Apply sound tweaks (e.g., silence camera shutter, lock sound, keyboard clicks).
-   Grouped list of tweaks by category.
-   "Apply All" option for file-zeroing tweaks.
-   Activity log to see the status of operations.

## How It Works (i'm not sure  how it actually works lol)

The application uses a C-based exploit (based on the `VM_BEHAVIOR_ZERO_WIRED_PAGES` technique) to zero out the first page (16KB) of targeted system files.
- It maps a read-only file into memory.
- Marks the memory entry with `VM_BEHAVIOR_ZERO_WIRED_PAGES`.
- Locks the page using `mlock()`.
- Deallocates the memory mapping, causing the kernel to zero out the underlying physical page backing that part of the file.

## Requirements

-   An iOS device
-   An iOS version where the underlying file-zeroing technique is adjustive. (below iOS 18.4)
-   Xcode to build the project.

## Building and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/speedyfriend433/mdcX.git
    cd mdcX
    ```
2.  **Open in Xcode:**
    Open the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file.
3.  **Bridging Header:**
    Ensure the Objective-C Bridging Header is correctly set up in Build Settings and includes `exploit_poc.h`.
4.  **C Code:**
    The C files (`exploit_poc.c` and `exploit_poc.h`) containing the exploit logic must be part of the target's "Compile Sources" build phase.
5.  **Sign and Build:**
    Configure bundle ids and you'll be able to build an IPA).
6.  **Create IPA:**
    Build the project and export as an IPA.
7.  **Install with Sideloadly or whatever:**
    Transfer the IPA to your device and install it.

## Usage

1.  Launch the app.
2.  Browse the list of available tweaks, grouped by category.
3.  Tap on a tweak's hammer icon (üî®) to apply it.
4.  Alternatively, use the "Apply All" button in the toolbar to attempt all listed file-zeroing tweaks.
5.  Observe the status messages and the activity log for results.
6.  **Manually respring or reboot your device** to see if the tweaks have taken effect.
